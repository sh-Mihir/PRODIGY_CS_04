# PRODIGY_CS_04
This is my task number - 4 of my Cyber Security internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Welcome to the Keylogger Program! This Python script captures and logs keystrokes using the `pynput` library. The keylogger listens for keyboard events and writes the captured keystrokes to a log file (key_log.txt). Special keys (such as Enter, Shift, and Ctrl) are logged within square brackets to distinguish them from regular alphanumeric keys.

Features:
* Logs all keystrokes, including special keys.
* Saves logged keystrokes in a file named key_log.txt.
* Continues to run and capture keystrokes until the Escape key (Esc) is pressed or the program is interrupted (Ctrl+C in the terminal).

__Note:__ Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.
